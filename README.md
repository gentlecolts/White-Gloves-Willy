dash springboards off of enemies  
use the swap magic to switch places with enemies

Enemies will be stunned when you swap or spring board off of them.  
Enemies cannot be hit by you when they are stunned, but they can be killed by the envrironment or other hats/hat projectiles.  
Left click will fire off the swap magic in the direction of your mouse.  
Right click will make your character dash in the HORIZONTAL direction of you mouse.

Props:

Barrels: These nifty little things kills the hats by rolling over them. Dash into the hats swap with the hats or do a Combination of the two to make sure the hats get run over  
You can also swap places with barrels if you so desire.

Banana Moon: The Banana Moon is a deadly prop. When it spawns in it will not harm anything. But as soon as you touch it the banana will destroy everything the hats love.  
You can even ride the moon like a chariot destroying any hat in your path.
